## Updated FFM Data

The R API package has been updated, with additional documentation. See here: https://ceff-tech.github.io/ffc_api_client/index.html.

The newly updated FFM data lives in CEFF Google Drive Folder [here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/12y_-6k3ZY4gqkBk1GtW62_uxAMj0GRuF)

Altered USGS gages have been re-run, using 2000+ gages in CA with daily flow data and:

 - Pull only gages with 10+ years of data post 1980 (n=935)
 - Run those through the FFC, a subset returned FFM data (n=748).
 - The gages that didn't work have missing data gaps within years:
    - the R package filters out any year that has more than 7 non-contiguous days of missing data
    - and filters out any year that has more than 2 consecutive missing days.
